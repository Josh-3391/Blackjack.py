# Blackjack.py

I have made an interactive Blackjack game written in Python. You can play against the dealer, draw cards, and try to get as close to 21 points as possible without busting. This game will randomize cards dealt, it has automated dealer logic, will account for player hit/stand choices, and it detects all win conditions.

Thanks for looking!
